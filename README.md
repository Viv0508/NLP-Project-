Text Summarizer

Everybody utilises programmes that use text summarising. A large number of those applications are for the website that posts articles on sports, entertainment, and daily news. We would rather read the article's summary rather than the full text because of our hectic schedules. Reading a summary provides a concise overview of the story and aids in identifying the area of interest.

Goal: Automatically condense long text documents into concise summaries, preserving essential information and meaning.

Benefits:
Information overload management
Time efficiency
Improved comprehension
Enhanced search and retrieval

Key Approaches:

Extraction-based:

Selects important sentences or phrases directly from the original text.
Methods include:
Frequency-based: Chooses sentences with frequently occurring words or phrases.
Topic-based: Identifies sentences representing key topics.
Graph-based: Models relationships between sentences and extracts central ones.

Abstraction-based:

Generates new sentences, potentially not found in the original text, to convey core ideas.
Often uses deep learning techniques (e.g., transformers) to understand and synthesize information.
